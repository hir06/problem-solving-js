Title: Implementing a Custom JSON.stringify Function
Description:
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a custom implementation of the JSON.stringify() method, which will be called myStringify. The JSON.stringify() method in JavaScript converts JavaScript objects or values to a JSON string. This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of data serialization in JavaScript by building your own version of this method.
Your function should handle the following data types:
- Primitive types: Number, String, Boolean, null
- Complex types: Objects, Arrays
Note that, unlike the native JSON.stringify(), your function does not need to address circular references, functions, or symbols.
Examples:
- Input: ['foo', 'bar']
  Output: '["foo", "bar"]'
- Input: { name: 'John', age: 30, isEmployed: true }
  Output: '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "isEmployed": true}'
- Input: 42
  Output: '42'
- Input: 'Hello, world!'
  Output: '"Hello, world!"'
- Input: true
  Output: 'true'
- Input: null
  Output: 'null'
Your implementation should correctly convert arrays and objects into their string representations, ensuring to wrap string values in double quotes and separate object properties with commas. Pay close attention to handling edge cases, such as empty objects or arrays.
Test Cases:
1. Stringify an Array
   - Description: Should correctly stringify an array.
   - Input: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
   - Expected Output: '["apple", "banana", "cherry"]'
2. Stringify an Object
   - Description: Should correctly stringify an object.
   - Input: { name: 'John', age: 30, isEmployed: true }
   - Expected Output: '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "isEmployed": true}'
3. Stringify Nested Arrays and Objects
   - Description: Should correctly stringify nested arrays and objects.
   - Input: { fruits: ['apple', 'banana'], person: { name: 'Alice', age: 25 } }
   - Expected Output: '{"fruits": ["apple", "banana"], "person": {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}}'
Constraints:
- The function should support primitive data types: Number, String, Boolean, and null.
- The function should support complex data types: Object (excluding functions, symbols, and circular references) and Array.
- The output string should be formatted correctly according to JSON standards, with object keys and string values enclosed in double quotes.
- Arrays and objects should be serialized recursively, with nested structures preserved in the output.
- Empty objects and arrays should be represented as {} and [] respectively in the output string.
- The function is expected to handle a nesting depth up to 5 levels for objects and arrays.
- The function should not use the native JSON.stringify() method in its implementation.
