# Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to our problem-solving repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring various data structures and algorithms using vanilla JavaScript. It's a great resource for anyone looking to improve their problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, or understand data structures better.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains solutions to problems related to various data structures such as:

- Trees
- Arrays
- Strings

We also delve into different algorithms, including:

- Recursion
- Backtracking

In addition, you'll find JavaScript polyfills, which are scripts that allow you to bring newer functionality to older browsers that do not natively support it.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the repository, clone it, or fork it. You can use the solutions here to learn, improve, or even contribute your own solutions!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a solution to a problem that isn't already in the repository, or if you have a more efficient solution, feel free to make a pull request.
